# Water Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Aim
To develop a machine learning model that predicts whether water is potable (safe to drink) or not potable based on physical and chemical properties.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Water Potability Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)  
- **File:** `data/water_potability.csv`  
- **Description:** Contains water quality parameters like pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, turbidity, and target `Potability` (1 = potable, 0 = not potable).

## Algorithm
1. Load dataset and examine structure.
2. Handle missing values (fill with median).
3. Separate features (`X`) and target (`y`).
4. Standardize features.
5. Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
6. Train a **Random Forest Classifier**.
7. Predict on test set and evaluate:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

## Results
- Accuracy: ~82% (varies with dataset split and preprocessing)
- Confusion Matrix Example:
